# Tic-Tac-Toe React App

This project is based on the official React documentation's tutorial, designed to teach the fundamentals of React, including components, props, state, and handling events. The application implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with additional features such as move history and a time-travel functionality, allowing users to revisit and resume the game from any previous state.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The app is built using React components, including `Square`, `Board`, and `Game`.
- **State Management**: Manages game state using React's `useState` hook.
- **Time-Travel Functionality**: Allows users to navigate through the game's history, revisiting any move and resuming play from that point.
- **Winner Detection**: Includes logic to determine and display the winner of the game.
